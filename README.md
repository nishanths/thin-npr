```
* Articles have smaller line-widths for easier reading.
* Opens stories in expanded mode upon opening. No need to click 
  on the "Read more..." link.
* Clicking the "text-only" footer link from regular npr.org 
  attempts to go to the corresponding thin page, instead of the
  thin.npr.org front page.
